NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
```

5. Deploy your application

#### 2. Create Supabase Table for LLM Metrics

Create a new table in your Supabase project to store LLM generation metrics:

  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  operation TEXT NOT NULL,
  time_ms INTEGER NOT NULL,
  question_count INTEGER,
  difficulty TEXT,
  success BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

#### 3. Test Your Frame

After deployment, you can test your Frame using the [Farcaster Frame validator](https://warpcast.com/~/developers/frames):

1. Enter your deployed URL
2. Verify that the Frame loads correctly
3. Test the interactions to ensure everything works as expected

#### 4. Submit to Farcaster Mini App Store
